# flashcard-exercise


This project is based on the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/learn/lecture/37350620#overview  

Starter files are provided by this course, as well as a prompt to create interactive flash card components. The rest was programmed by me. 

This project uses Create-React-App and can be run using npm start. The styling is done using Tailwind CSS.

The project uses state to keep track of answers being shown. It toggles only one answer at a time.
