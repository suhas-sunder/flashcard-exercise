# flashcard-exercise


This project is based on the following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/learn/lecture/37350620#overview  

Starter files are provided by this course, as well as a prompt to create interactive flash card components. The rest was programmed by me. 

This project uses Create-React-App and can be run using npm start. The styling is done using Tailwind CSS.

Version 1 is stateless and doesn't revert answers back to questions when multiple questions are clicked.
